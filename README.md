## Treatment with pembrolizumab beyond disease progression and survival of patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma

This repository contains the R code used for the analysis presented in the research paper "Clinical benefit of continuing pembrolizumab treatment beyond progression in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma." The study evaluates the effectiveness of continuing pembrolizumab therapy beyond progression in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC).

### Abstract
This retrospective observational study investigates the effect of continuing pembrolizumab treatment beyond progression on overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic UC. We analyzed data from 51 patients who developed progression during second-line pembrolizumab therapy. The association between continued treatment and OS was assessed using log-rank test, conventional and time-dependent Cox regression models.
We found evidence that patients who continued pembrolizumab treatment beyond progression had longer OS compared to those who discontinued treatment. The results suggest that continued pembrolizumab administration beyond progression might be beneficial in patients with metastatic UC who were clinically stable.
